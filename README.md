# Lobby-datapack
This is a datapack for Minecraft. To use the Plugin you must have op. In order for the lobby to be recognized, you have to replace the bedrock at height 0 with air.
You can make the lobby as big as you want.
So that you don't change the game mode, you have to give yourself the tag op. You can do this by typing /tag @s add op into the chat.
